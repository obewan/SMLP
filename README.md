# SMLP

A Simple Multi-Layer Perceptron, by [Dams](https://dams-labs.net/).  
Each neurons of a previous layer is connected with each neurons of its next layer.

# Features

- Simplicity (the "S" of SMLP) for better understanding and for studying purpose, for improved maintainance and performance, and for compliance with best software development practices (low complexity, KISS principle). It can also be used as base for more complex projects.
- Functionality: operational, including forward propagation, backward propagation and weight update.
- Performance: uses C++ for optimal performance, and less CPU and memory usage.
- [Csv-parser](https://github.com/ashaduri/csv-parser) for CSV parsing. Dataset learning on the fly line by line (instead of loading the entire dataset into memory), resulting in low memory usage.
- [CLI11](https://github.com/CLIUtils/CLI11) for command line parsing.
- [JSON for Modern C++](https://github.com/nlohmann/json) for Json export/import.
- [Cmake](https://cmake.org) compilation, tested on Linux, but should be portable to other systems.
- [Doctest](https://github.com/doctest/doctest) for unit tests.
- [Gcov](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Gcov.html) and [Lcov](https://github.com/linux-test-project/lcov) for code coverage, with 80% of minimum coverage validation.
- [Ctest](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/book/mastering-cmake/chapter/Testing%20With%20CMake%20and%20CTest.html) for integration tests.
- [Github Continuous Integration](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/automating-builds-and-tests/about-continuous-integration) with an unit test and a integration test checks.
- [Github CodeQL](https://github.com/features/security/code) security analysis.
- [Sonarlint](https://www.sonarsource.com/products/sonarlint) code analysis.
- [Doxygen](https://www.doxygen.nl) documentation.
- Includes a mushroom edibility dataset example.

# Roadmap to first release

- Add a pipe input. `[in progress]`
- Add a socket input.
- Add an interactive testing (command line input).
- Add an auto-training feature (searching for the best parameters).
- Add a GUI (but probably on a more advanced project).

_Tensors, CUDA support and ONNX (Open Neural Network Exchange) format will be for an other and more advanced AI project._

# Usage

1. Prepare a dataset in CSV format with comma separation and with only float numbers ranging from 0 to 1 (example in data/mushroom we use a simple awk script to format mushroom_data_orig.csv into mushroom_data.csv).
2. Build and run smlp (should be located in _build_ directory then).
3. To get command line help: `smlp -h`
4. You can specify the running mode with the `mode` option (`-m` parameter):
   - Predictive: This mode uses an input file to predict the outputs. If the input file contains output columns, the predicted CSV outputs will replace them without modifying the original input file. Please be mindful of the parameters (input_size, output_size, output_ends). If the input file does not contain output columns, pay close attention to the input_size parameter. This mode requires a network model that has been imported and trained (be sure that the model has good testing results).
   - TestOnly: Test an imported network without training.
   - TrainOnly: Train the network without testing.
   - TrainThenTest: Train and then test the network (default mode).
   - TrainTestMonitored: Train and test at each epoch while monitoring the progress of an output neuron. Be aware that this is slower and uses more memory.
5. You can also use a `smlp.conf` file in JSON format, located in the same directory as the smlp program. This way, you won’t have to use the corresponding parameters on the command line. Currently, it supports:
   - `lang_file`: The language file to use for the help. Currently available, by alphabetic order:
     - `i18n/de.json` (german)
     - `i18n/en.json` (english)
     - `i18n/es.json` (spanish)
     - `i18n/fr.json` (french)
     - `i18n/it.json` (italian)
     - `i18n/pt.json` (portuguese)
   - `file_input`: The dataset file to use, similar to the file_input option.
   - `import_network`: The model file to import, similar to the import_network option.
   - `export_network`: The model file to export, similar to the export_network option.

If you use the corresponding command line options, they will override the config file parameters. Here an example of `smlp.conf`:

```json
{
  "lang_file": "i18n/en.json",
  "file_input": "../data/mushroom/mushroom_data.csv",
  "import_network": "mushroom_model.json",
  "export_network": "mushroom_model_new.json"
}
```

```
SMLP - Simple Multilayer Perceptron
Usage: ./smlp [OPTIONS]

# Examples

### Example 1: Training

Training a new MLP with the mushroom dataset, 20 inputs (-s), 1 output (-o), 12 neurons by hidden layers (-d), 1 hidden layer (-c), during 100 epochs (-p), output at beginning of the dataset (no -t), with a ReLU activation function on hidden layer (-a) and with monitored tests (-m). Then exporting the model to myMushroomMLP.json after the training (-e).

`smlp -e myMushroomMLP.json -f ../data/mushroom/mushroom_data.csv -s 20 -o 1 -d 12 -c 1 -p 100 -a ReLU -m TrainTestMonitored`

Output:

The first column represents the predicted result: 1 signifies that the mushroom is likely edible, while 0 indicates it is likely not edible. These predictions are made with an accuracy of 80%, meaning that there is an 80% confidence in these predictions. However, caution is advised. While we can strive to improve the accuracy of the model, it’s important to remember that predictions are inherently probabilistic and will never reach 100% certainty, mirroring the inherent uncertainties of real life.
