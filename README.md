# SMLP

A Simple Multi-Layer Perceptron.  
Each neurons of a previous layer is connected with each neurons of its next layer.  
The neural network will use a sigmoid activation function currently.

# Roadmap

- add unit-tests (with code coverage) and continuous integration
- add import/export of the model
- add training/testing modes
- add an auto training (searching for best parameters)
- add more activation functions that can be selected
- add a GUI (but probably on a more advanced project)

# Usage

- Prepare a dataset into a csv format with only float numbers from range 0 to 1 (example in test/mushroom we use a simple awk script to format mushroom_data_orig.csv into mushroom_data.csv)
- build and run smlp (should be in build directory then)
- to get command line help: `smlp -h`
- the `input_size` parameter (`-i` parameter) should be equal to the number of input data of your dataset, and the `output_size` (`-o` parameter) to the output data of your dataset. input_size + output_size should be equal to your data fields number. If your output is at the beginning of your data rows, you can indicate it with the `output_ends` parameter (`-z` parameter).
- `epochs` (`-e` paramater) will retrain the neural network with the dataset but after a backward propagation correction. It is better to set at least 100 epochs.
- the line_to number delimiter (`-l` parameter) is the line number from which smlp will use the remain dataset lines for test and not for train, so the first part is used for training and the second part of the file for testing. It should be a valid number, and be at around 70% of the datafile
- the `learning_rate` (`-r` parameter) should be small enought to have a fine training but big enought to be efficient, a value of 0.01 is recommanded with the mushroom example.
- increasing the hidden neurons per hidden layers `hidden_size` (`-d` parameter) and the hidden layers count `hiddens_count` (`-c` parameter) will make the neural network more complex and the training will goes slower. Using just one hidden layer with 10 neurons is fine with a simple dataset like our mushroom example.

# Example

`smlp -f ../test/mushroom/mushroom_data.csv -i 20 -o 1 -d 12 -c 1 -e 100 -l 40000 -r 0.01 -v false`
